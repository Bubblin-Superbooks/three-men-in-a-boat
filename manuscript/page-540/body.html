<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Among folk too constitutionally weak, or too constitutionally lazy, whichever it may be, to relish up-stream work, it is a common practice to get a boat at Oxford, and row down.&nbsp; For the energetic, however, the up-stream journey is certainly to be preferred.&nbsp; It does not seem good to be always going with the current.&nbsp; There is more satisfaction in squaring one&rsquo;s back, and fighting against it, and winning one&rsquo;s way forward in spite of it&mdash;at least, so I feel, when Harris and George are sculling and I am steering.</p><p>To those who do contemplate making Oxford their starting-place, I would say, take your own boat&mdash;unless, of course, you can take someone else&rsquo;s without any possible danger of being found out.&nbsp; The boats that, as a rule, are let for hire on the Thames above Marlow, are very good boats.</p></div> </div>
