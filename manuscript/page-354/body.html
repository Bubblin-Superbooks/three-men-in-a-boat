<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I heard a man, going up a mountain in Switzerland, once say he would give worlds for a glass of beer, and, when he came to a little shanty where they kept it, he kicked up a most fearful row because they charged him five francs for a bottle of Bass.&nbsp; He said it was a scandalous imposition, and he wrote to the Times about it.</p><p>It cast a gloom over the boat, there being no mustard.&nbsp; We ate our beef in silence.&nbsp; Existence seemed hollow and uninteresting.&nbsp; We thought of the happy days of childhood, and sighed.&nbsp; We brightened up a bit, however, over the apple-tart, and, when George drew out a tin of pine-apple from the bottom of the hamper, and rolled it into the middle of the boat, we felt that life was worth living after all.</p></div> </div>
