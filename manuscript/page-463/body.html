<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Plain practical rowing of the get-the-boat-along order is not a very difficult art to acquire, but it takes a good deal of practice before a man feels comfortable, when rowing past girls.&nbsp; It is the &ldquo;time&rdquo; that worries a youngster.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s jolly funny,&rdquo; he says, as for the twentieth time within five minutes he disentangles his sculls from yours; &ldquo;I can get on all right when I&rsquo;m by myself!&rdquo;</p><p>To see two novices try to keep time with one another is very amusing.&nbsp; Bow finds it impossible to keep pace with stroke, because stroke rows in such an extraordinary fashion.&nbsp; Stroke is intensely indignant at this, and explains that what he has been endeavouring to do for the last ten minutes is to adapt his method to bow&rsquo;s limited capacity.</p></div> </div>
