<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The chief beauty of this book lies not so much in its literary style, or in the extent and usefulness of the information it conveys, as in its simple truthfulness.&nbsp; Its pages form the record of events that really happened.&nbsp; All that has been done is to colour them; and, for this, no extra charge has been made.&nbsp; George and Harris and Montmorency are not poetic ideals, but things of flesh and blood&mdash;especially George, who weighs about twelve stone.&nbsp; Other works may excel this in depth of thought and knowledge of human nature: other books may rival it in originality and size; but, for hopeless and incurable veracity, nothing yet discovered can surpass it.&nbsp; This, more than all its other charms, will, it is felt, make the volume precious in the eye of the earnest reader; and will lend additional weight to the lesson that the story teaches.</p><p>London, August, 1889.</p></div> </div>
