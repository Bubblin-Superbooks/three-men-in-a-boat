<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was a great success, that Irish stew.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I ever enjoyed a meal more.&nbsp; There was something so fresh and piquant about it.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s palate gets so tired of the old hackneyed things: here was a dish with a new flavour, with a taste like nothing else on earth.</p><p>And it was nourishing, too.&nbsp; As George said, there was good stuff in it.&nbsp; The peas and potatoes might have been a bit softer, but we all had good teeth, so that did not matter much: and as for the gravy, it was a poem&mdash;a little too rich, perhaps, for a weak stomach, but nutritious.</p><p>We finished up with tea and cherry tart.&nbsp; Montmorency had a fight with the kettle during tea-time, and came off a poor second.</p></div> </div>
