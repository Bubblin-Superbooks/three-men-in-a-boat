<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Should we &ldquo;camp out&rdquo; or sleep at inns?</p><p>George and I were for camping out.&nbsp; We said it would be so wild and free, so patriarchal like.</p><p>Slowly the golden memory of the dead sun fades from the hearts of the cold, sad clouds.&nbsp; Silent, like sorrowing children, the birds have ceased their song, and only the moorhen&rsquo;s plaintive cry and the harsh croak of the corncrake stirs the awed hush around the couch of waters, where the dying day breathes out her last.</p><p>From the dim woods on either bank, Night&rsquo;s ghostly army, the grey shadows, creep out with noiseless tread to chase away the lingering rear-guard of the light, and pass, with noiseless, unseen feet, above the waving river-grass, and through the sighing rushes;</p></div> </div>
