<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Harris asked me if I&rsquo;d ever been in the maze at Hampton Court.&nbsp; He said he went in once to show somebody else the way.&nbsp; He had studied it up in a map, and it was so simple that it seemed foolish&mdash;hardly worth the twopence charged for admission.&nbsp; Harris said he thought that map must have been got up as a practical joke, because it wasn&rsquo;t a bit like the real thing, and only misleading.&nbsp; It was a country cousin that Harris took in.&nbsp; He said:</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just go in here, so that you can say you&rsquo;ve been, but it&rsquo;s very simple.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s absurd to call it a maze.&nbsp; You keep on taking the first turning to the right.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll just walk round for ten minutes, and then go and get some lunch.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
