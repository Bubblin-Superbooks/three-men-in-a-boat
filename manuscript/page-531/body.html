<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We were up early the next morning, as we wanted to be in Oxford by the afternoon.&nbsp; It is surprising how early one can get up, when camping out.&nbsp; One does not yearn for &ldquo;just another five minutes&rdquo; nearly so much, lying wrapped up in a rug on the boards of a boat, with a Gladstone bag for a pillow, as one does in a featherbed.&nbsp; We had finished breakfast, and were through Clifton Lock by half-past eight.</p><p>From Clifton to Culham the river banks are flat, monotonous, and uninteresting, but, after you get through Culhalm Lock&mdash;the coldest and deepest lock on the river&mdash;the landscape improves.</p></div> </div>
