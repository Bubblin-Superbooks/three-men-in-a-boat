<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> silent ghosts with eyes reproachful, like the ghosts of evil actions, like the ghosts of friends neglected&mdash;is a spirit-haunted water through the land of vain regrets.</p><p>Sunlight is the life-blood of Nature.&nbsp; Mother Earth looks at us with such dull, soulless eyes, when the sunlight has died away from out of her.&nbsp; It makes us sad to be with her then; she does not seem to know us or to care for us.&nbsp; She is as a widow who has lost the husband she loved, and her children touch her hand, and look up into her eyes, but gain no smile from her.</p><p>We rowed on all that day through the rain, and very melancholy work it was.&nbsp; We pretended, at first, that we enjoyed it.&nbsp; We said it was a change, and that we liked to see the river under all its different aspects.</p></div> </div>
