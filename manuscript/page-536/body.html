<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I don&rsquo;t know why it should be, but everybody is always so exceptionally irritable on the river.&nbsp; Little mishaps, that you would hardly notice on dry land, drive you nearly frantic with rage, when they occur on the water.&nbsp; When Harris or George makes an ass of himself on dry land, I smile indulgently; when they behave in a chuckle-head way on the river, I use the most blood-curdling language to them.&nbsp; When another boat gets in my way, I feel I want to take an oar and kill all the people in it.</p><p>The mildest tempered people, when on land, become violent and blood-thirsty when in a boat.&nbsp; I did a little boating once with a young lady.&nbsp; She was naturally of the sweetest and gentlest disposition imaginable, but on the river it was quite awful to hear her.</p></div> </div>
