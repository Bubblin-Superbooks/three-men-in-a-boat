<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Lee&mdash;five times Mayor of Abingdon&mdash;was, no doubt, a benefactor to his generation, but I hope there are not many of his kind about in this overcrowded nineteenth century.</p><p>From Abingdon to Nuneham Courteney is a lovely stretch.&nbsp; Nuneham Park is well worth a visit.&nbsp; It can be viewed on Tuesdays and Thursdays.&nbsp; The house contains a fine collection of pictures and curiosities, and the grounds are very beautiful.</p><p>The pool under Sandford lasher, just behind the lock, is a very good place to drown yourself in.&nbsp; The undercurrent is terribly strong, and if you once get down into it you are all right.&nbsp; An obelisk marks the spot where two men have already been drowned, while bathing there; and the steps of the obelisk are generally used as a diving-board by young men now who wish to see if the place really is dangerous.</p></div> </div>
