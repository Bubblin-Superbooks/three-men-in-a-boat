<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;Heavy showers, with thunderstorms, may be expected to-day,&rdquo; it would say on Monday, and so we would give up our picnic, and stop indoors all day, waiting for the rain.&mdash;And people would pass the house, going off in wagonettes and coaches as jolly and merry as could be, the sun shining out, and not a cloud to be seen.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; we said, as we stood looking out at them through the window, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t they come home soaked!&rdquo;</p><p>And we chuckled to think how wet they were going to get, and came back and stirred the fire, and got our books, and arranged our specimens of seaweed and cockle shells.&nbsp; By twelve o&rsquo;clock, with the sun pouring into the room, the heat became quite oppressive, and we wondered when those heavy showers and occasional thunderstorms were going to begin.</p></div> </div>
