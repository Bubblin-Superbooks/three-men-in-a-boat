<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Talking of locks reminds me of an accident George and I very nearly had one summer&rsquo;s morning at Hampton Court.</p><p>It was a glorious day, and the lock was crowded; and, as is a common practice up the river, a speculative photographer was taking a picture of us all as we lay upon the rising waters.</p><p>I did not catch what was going on at first, and was, therefore, extremely surprised at noticing George hurriedly smooth out his trousers, ruffle up his hair, and stick his cap on in a rakish manner at the back of his head, and then, assuming an expression of mingled affability and sadness, sit down in a graceful attitude, and try to hide his feet.</p></div> </div>
