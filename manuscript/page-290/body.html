<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I did get to sleep for a few hours, and then some part of the boat which seemed to have grown up in the night&mdash;for it certainly was not there when we started, and it had disappeared by the morning&mdash;kept digging into my spine.&nbsp; I slept through it for a while, dreaming that I had swallowed a sovereign, and that they were cutting a hole in my back with a gimlet, so as to try and get it out.&nbsp; I thought it very unkind of them, and I told them I would owe them the money, and they should have it at the end of the month.&nbsp; But they would not hear of that, and said it would be much better if they had it then, because otherwise the interest would accumulate so.&nbsp; I got quite cross with them after a bit, and told them what I thought of them, and then they gave the gimlet such an excruciating wrench that I woke up.</p></div> </div>
