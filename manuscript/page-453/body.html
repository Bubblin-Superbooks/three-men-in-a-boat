<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; My own earliest boating recollection is of five of us contributing threepence each and taking out a curiously constructed craft on the Regent&rsquo;s Park lake, drying ourselves subsequently, in the park-keeper&rsquo;s lodge.</p><p>After that, having acquired a taste for the water, I did a good deal of rafting in various suburban brickfields&mdash;an exercise providing more interest and excitement than might be imagined, especially when you are in the middle of the pond and the proprietor of the materials of which the raft is constructed suddenly appears on the bank, with a big stick in his hand.</p><p>Your first sensation on seeing this gentleman is that, somehow or other, you don&rsquo;t feel equal to company and conversation, and that, if you could do so without appearing rude, you would rather avoid meeting him;</p></div> </div>
