<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Dorchester, like Wallingford, was a city in ancient British times; it was then called Caer Doren, &ldquo;the city on the water.&rdquo;&nbsp; In more recent times the Romans formed a great camp here, the fortifications surrounding which now seem like low, even hills.&nbsp; In Saxon days it was the capital of Wessex.&nbsp; It is very old, and it was very strong and great once.&nbsp; Now it sits aside from the stirring world, and nods and dreams.</p><p>Round Clifton Hampden, itself a wonderfully pretty village, old-fashioned, peaceful, and dainty with flowers, the river scenery is rich and beautiful.&nbsp; If you stay the night on land at Clifton, you cannot do better than put up at the &ldquo;Barley Mow.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is, without exception, I should say, the quaintest, most old-world inn up the river.&nbsp; It stands on the right of the bridge, quite away from the village.</p></div> </div>
