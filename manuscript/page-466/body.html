<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One young man I knew had a very sad accident happen to him the first time he went punting.&nbsp; He had been getting on so well that he had grown quite cheeky over the business, and was walking up and down the punt, working his pole with a careless grace that was quite fascinating to watch.&nbsp; Up he would march to the head of the punt, plant his pole, and then run along right to the other end, just like an old punter.&nbsp; Oh! it was grand.</p><p>And it would all have gone on being grand if he had not unfortunately, while looking round to enjoy the scenery, taken just one step more than there was any necessity for, and walked off the punt altogether.&nbsp; The pole was firmly fixed in the mud, and he was left clinging to it while the punt drifted away.&nbsp; It was an undignified position for him.</p></div> </div>
