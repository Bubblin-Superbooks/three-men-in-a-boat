<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At Reading lock we came up with a steam launch, belonging to some friends of mine, and they towed us up to within about a mile of Streatley.&nbsp; It is very delightful being towed up by a launch.&nbsp; I prefer it myself to rowing.&nbsp; The run would have been more delightful still, if it had not been for a lot of wretched small boats that were continually getting in the way of our launch, and, to avoid running down which, we had to be continually easing and stopping.&nbsp; It is really most annoying, the manner in which these rowing boats get in the way of one&rsquo;s launch up the river; something ought to done to stop it.</p></div> </div>
