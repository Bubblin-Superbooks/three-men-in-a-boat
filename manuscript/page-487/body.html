<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>My friends&rsquo; launch cast us loose just below the grotto, and then Harris wanted to make out that it was my turn to pull.&nbsp; This seemed to me most unreasonable.&nbsp; It had been arranged in the morning that I should bring the boat up to three miles above Reading.&nbsp; Well, here we were, ten miles above Reading!&nbsp; Surely it was now their turn again.</p><p>I could not get either George or Harris to see the matter in its proper light, however; so, to save argument, I took the sculls.&nbsp; I had not been pulling for more than a minute or so, when George noticed something black floating on the water, and we drew up to it.&nbsp; George leant over, as we neared it, and laid hold of it.&nbsp; And then he drew back with a cry, and a blanched face.</p></div> </div>
