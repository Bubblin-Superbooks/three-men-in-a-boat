<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We made a list of the things to be taken, and a pretty lengthy one it was, before we parted that evening.&nbsp; The next day, which was Friday, we got them all together, and met in the evening to pack.&nbsp; We got a big Gladstone for the clothes, and a couple of hampers for the victuals and the cooking utensils.&nbsp; We moved the table up against the window, piled everything in a heap in the middle of the floor, and sat round and looked at it.</p><p>I said I&rsquo;d pack.</p><p>I rather pride myself on my packing.&nbsp; Packing is one of those many things that I feel I know more about than any other person living.&nbsp; (It surprises me myself, sometimes, how many of these subjects there are.)&nbsp; I impressed the fact upon George and Harris, and told them that they had better leave the whole matter entirely to me.</p></div> </div>
