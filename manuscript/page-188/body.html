<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; replied Harris.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a lady that&rsquo;s got a funny tomb, and I want to see it.&rdquo;</p><p>I objected.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether it is that I am built wrong, but I never did seem to hanker after tombstones myself.&nbsp; I know that the proper thing to do, when you get to a village or town, is to rush off to the churchyard, and enjoy the graves; but it is a recreation that I always deny myself.&nbsp; I take no interest in creeping round dim and chilly churches behind wheezy old men, and reading epitaphs.&nbsp; Not even the sight of a bit of cracked brass let into a stone affords me what I call real happiness.</p></div> </div>
