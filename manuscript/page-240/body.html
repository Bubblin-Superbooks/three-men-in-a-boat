<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I do not wish to be insulting, but I firmly believe that if you took an average tow-line, and stretched it out straight across the middle of a field, and then turned your back on it for thirty seconds, that, when you looked round again, you would find that it had got itself altogether in a heap in the middle of the field, and had twisted itself up, and tied itself into knots, and lost its two ends, and become all loops; and it would take you a good half-hour, sitting down there on the grass and swearing all the while, to disentangle it again.</p><p>That is my opinion of tow-lines in general.&nbsp; Of course, there may be honourable exceptions; I do not say that there are not.&nbsp; There may be tow-lines that are a credit to their profession&mdash;conscientious, respectable tow-lines&mdash;</p></div> </div>
