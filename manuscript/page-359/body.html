<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Maidenhead itself is too snobby to be pleasant.&nbsp; It is the haunt of the river swell and his overdressed female companion.&nbsp; It is the town of showy hotels, patronised chiefly by dudes and ballet girls.&nbsp; It is the witch&rsquo;s kitchen from which go forth those demons of the river&mdash;steam-launches.&nbsp; The London Journal duke always has his &ldquo;little place&rdquo; at Maidenhead; and the heroine of the three-volume novel always dines there when she goes out on the spree with somebody else&rsquo;s husband.</p><p>We went through Maidenhead quickly, and then eased up, and took leisurely that grand reach beyond Boulter&rsquo;s and Cookham locks.&nbsp; Clieveden Woods still wore their dainty dress of spring, and rose up, from the water&rsquo;s edge, in one long harmony of blended shades of fairy green.</p></div> </div>
