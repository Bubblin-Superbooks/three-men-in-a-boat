<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I called for the cheeses, and took them away in a cab.&nbsp; It was a ramshackle affair, dragged along by a knock-kneed, broken-winded somnambulist, which his owner, in a moment of enthusiasm, during conversation, referred to as a horse.&nbsp; I put the cheeses on the top, and we started off at a shamble that would have done credit to the swiftest steam-roller ever built, and all went merry as a funeral bell, until we turned the corner.&nbsp; There, the wind carried a whiff from the cheeses full on to our steed.&nbsp; It woke him up, and, with a snort of terror, he dashed off at three miles an hour.&nbsp; The wind still blew in his direction, and before we reached the end of the street he was laying himself out at the rate of nearly four miles an hour, leaving the cripples and stout old ladies simply nowhere.</p></div> </div>
