<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I thought of hobgoblins and banshees, and will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps, and those wicked girls who sit up all night on rocks, and lure people into whirl-pools and things; and I wished I had been a better man, and knew more hymns; and in the middle of these reflections I heard the blessed strains of &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got &rsquo;em on,&rdquo; played, badly, on a concertina, and knew that we were saved.</p><p>I do not admire the tones of a concertina, as a rule; but, oh! how beautiful the music seemed to us both then&mdash;far, far more beautiful than the voice of Orpheus or the lute of Apollo, or anything of that sort could have sounded.&nbsp; Heavenly melody, in our then state of mind, would only have still further harrowed us.&nbsp; A soul-moving harmony, correctly performed, we should have taken as a spirit-warning, and have given up all hope.</p></div> </div>
