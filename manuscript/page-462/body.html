<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I like to watch an old boatman rowing, especially one who has been hired by the hour.&nbsp; There is something so beautifully calm and restful about his method.&nbsp; It is so free from that fretful haste, that vehement striving, that is every day becoming more and more the bane of nineteenth-century life.&nbsp; He is not for ever straining himself to pass all the other boats.&nbsp; If another boat overtakes him and passes him it does not annoy him; as a matter of fact, they all do overtake him and pass him&mdash;all those that are going his way.&nbsp; This would trouble and irritate some people; the sublime equanimity of the hired boatman under the ordeal affords us a beautiful lesson against ambition and uppishness.</p></div> </div>
