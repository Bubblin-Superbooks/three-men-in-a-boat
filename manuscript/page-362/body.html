<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There is no more thrilling sensation I know of than sailing.&nbsp; It comes as near to flying as man has got to yet&mdash;except in dreams.&nbsp; The wings of the rushing wind seem to be bearing you onward, you know not where.&nbsp; You are no longer the slow, plodding, puny thing of clay, creeping tortuously upon the ground; you are a part of Nature!&nbsp; Your heart is throbbing against hers!&nbsp; Her glorious arms are round you, raising you up against her heart!&nbsp; Your spirit is at one with hers; your limbs grow light!&nbsp; The voices of the air are singing to you.&nbsp; The earth seems far away and little; and the clouds, so close above your head, are brothers, and you stretch your arms to them.</p></div> </div>
