<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We asked this heavenly messenger (as we discovered him afterwards to be) if he knew of any lonely house, whose occupants were few and feeble (old ladies or paralysed gentlemen preferred), who could be easily frightened into giving up their beds for the night to three desperate men; or, if not this, could he recommend us to an empty pigstye, or a disused limekiln, or anything of that sort.&nbsp; He did not know of any such place&mdash;at least, not one handy; but he said that, if we liked to come with him, his mother had a room to spare, and could put us up for the night.</p><p>We fell upon his neck there in the moonlight and blessed him, and it would have made a very beautiful picture if the boy himself had not been so over-powered by our emotion as to be unable to sustain himself under it, and sunk to the ground, letting us all down on top of him.</p></div> </div>
