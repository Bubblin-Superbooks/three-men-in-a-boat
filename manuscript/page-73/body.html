<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>George comes out really quite sensible at times.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d be surprised.&nbsp; I call that downright wisdom, not merely as regards the present case, but with reference to our trip up the river of life, generally.&nbsp; How many people, on that voyage, load up the boat till it is ever in danger of swamping with a store of foolish things which they think essential to the pleasure and comfort of the trip, but which are really only useless lumber.</p><p>How they pile the poor little craft mast-high with fine clothes and big houses; with useless servants, and a host of swell friends that do not care twopence for them, and that they do not care three ha&rsquo;pence for; with expensive entertainments that nobody enjoys, with formalities and fashions, with pretence and ostentation, and with&mdash;oh, heaviest, maddest lumber of all!&mdash;</p></div> </div>
