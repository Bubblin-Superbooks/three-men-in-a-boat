<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The river up to Sonning winds in and out through many islands, and is very placid, hushed, and lonely.&nbsp; Few folk, except at twilight, a pair or two of rustic lovers, walk along its banks.&nbsp; &rsquo;Arry and Lord Fitznoodle have been left behind at Henley, and dismal, dirty Reading is not yet reached.&nbsp; It is a part of the river in which to dream of bygone days, and vanished forms and faces, and things that might have been, but are not, confound them.</p><p>We got out at Sonning, and went for a walk round the village.&nbsp; It is the most fairy-like little nook on the whole river.&nbsp; It is more like a stage village than one built of bricks and mortar.&nbsp; Every house is smothered in roses, and now, in early June, they were bursting forth in clouds of dainty splendour.</p></div> </div>
