<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Gay-cloaked companies of knights and squires have ridden in, all travel-stained and dusty.&nbsp; And all the evening long the timid townsmen&rsquo;s doors have had to be quick opened to let in rough groups of soldiers, for whom there must be found both board and lodging, and the best of both, or woe betide the house and all within; for the sword is judge and jury, plaintiff and executioner, in these tempestuous times, and pays for what it takes by sparing those from whom it takes it, if it pleases it to do so.</p><p>Round the camp-fire in the market-place gather still more of the Barons&rsquo; troops, and eat and drink deep, and bellow forth roystering drinking songs, and gamble and quarrel as the evening grows and deepens into night.&nbsp; The firelight sheds quaint shadows on their piled-up arms and on their uncouth forms.</p></div> </div>
