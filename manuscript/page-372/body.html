<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&rdquo;&nbsp; Just past the weir (going up) is Danes&rsquo; Field, where the invading Danes once encamped, during their march to Gloucestershire; and a little further still, nestling by a sweet corner of the stream, is what is left of Medmenham Abbey.</p><p>The famous Medmenham monks, or &ldquo;Hell Fire Club,&rdquo; as they were commonly called, and of whom the notorious Wilkes was a member, were a fraternity whose motto was &ldquo;Do as you please,&rdquo; and that invitation still stands over the ruined doorway of the abbey.&nbsp; Many years before this bogus abbey, with its congregation of irreverent jesters, was founded, there stood upon this same spot a monastery of a sterner kind, whose monks were of a somewhat different type to the revellers that were to follow them, five hundred years afterwards.</p></div> </div>
