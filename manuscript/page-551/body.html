<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We hoisted the cover before we had lunch, and kept it up all the afternoon, just leaving a little space in the bow, from which one of us could paddle and keep a look-out.&nbsp; In this way we made nine miles, and pulled up for the night a little below Day&rsquo;s Lock.</p><p>I cannot honestly say that we had a merry evening.&nbsp; The rain poured down with quiet persistency.&nbsp; Everything in the boat was damp and clammy.&nbsp; Supper was not a success.&nbsp; Cold veal pie, when you don&rsquo;t feel hungry, is apt to cloy.&nbsp; I felt I wanted whitebait and a cutlet; Harris babbled of soles and white-sauce, and passed the remains of his pie to Montmorency, who declined it, and, apparently insulted by the offer, went and sat over at the other end of the boat by himself.</p></div> </div>
