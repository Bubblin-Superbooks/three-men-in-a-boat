<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I lived with a man once who used to make me mad that way.&nbsp; He would loll on the sofa and watch me doing things by the hour together, following me round the room with his eyes, wherever I went.&nbsp; He said it did him real good to look on at me, messing about.&nbsp; He said it made him feel that life was not an idle dream to be gaped and yawned through, but a noble task, full of duty and stern work.&nbsp; He said he often wondered now how he could have gone on before he met me, never having anybody to look at while they worked.</p><p>Now, I&rsquo;m not like that.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t sit still and see another man slaving and working.&nbsp; I want to get up and superintend, and walk round with my hands in my pockets, and tell him what to do.&nbsp; It is my energetic nature.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help it.</p></div> </div>
