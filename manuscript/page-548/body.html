<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The river&mdash;with the sunlight flashing from its dancing wavelets, gilding gold the grey-green beech-trunks, glinting through the dark, cool wood paths, chasing shadows o&rsquo;er the shallows, flinging diamonds from the mill-wheels, throwing kisses to the lilies, wantoning with the weirs&rsquo; white waters, silvering moss-grown walls and bridges, brightening every tiny townlet, making sweet each lane and meadow, lying tangled in the rushes, peeping, laughing, from each inlet, gleaming gay on many a far sail, making soft the air with glory&mdash;is a golden fairy stream.</p><p>But the river&mdash;chill and weary, with the ceaseless rain-drops falling on its brown and sluggish waters, with a sound as of a woman, weeping low in some dark chamber; while the woods, all dark and silent, shrouded in their mists of vapour, stand like ghosts upon the margin;</p></div> </div>
