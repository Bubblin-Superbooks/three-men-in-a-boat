<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> one of their number, a shock-headed youth, named Joskins, who had once or twice taken out a boat on the Serpentine, told them it was jolly fun, boating!</p><p>The tide was running out pretty rapidly when they reached the landing-stage, and there was a stiff breeze blowing across the river, but this did not trouble them at all, and they proceeded to select their boat.</p><p>There was an eight-oared racing outrigger drawn up on the stage; that was the one that took their fancy.&nbsp; They said they&rsquo;d have that one, please.&nbsp; The boatman was away, and only his boy was in charge.&nbsp; The boy tried to damp their ardour for the outrigger, and showed them two or three very comfortable-looking boats of the family-party build, but those would not do at all; the outrigger was the boat they thought they would look best in.</p></div> </div>
