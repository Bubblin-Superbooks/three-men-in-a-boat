<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Your first impression is that the end of the world has come; and then you think that this cannot be, and that it is thieves and murderers, or else fire, and this opinion you express in the usual method.&nbsp; No help comes, however, and all you know is that thousands of people are kicking you, and you are being smothered.</p><p>Somebody else seems in trouble, too.&nbsp; You can hear his faint cries coming from underneath your bed.&nbsp; Determining, at all events, to sell your life dearly, you struggle frantically, hitting out right and left with arms and legs, and yelling lustily the while, and at last something gives way, and you find your head in the fresh air.&nbsp; Two feet off, you dimly observe a half-dressed ruffian, waiting to kill you, and you are preparing for a life-and-death struggle with him, when it begins to dawn upon you that it&rsquo;s Jim.</p></div> </div>
