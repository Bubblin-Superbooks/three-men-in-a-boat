<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; There must have been a boat attached to that tow-line at some time or other, that was certain; but what had become of it, what ghastly fate had overtaken it, and those who had been left in it, was buried in mystery.&nbsp; Whatever the accident may have been, however, it had in no way disturbed the young lady and gentleman, who were towing.&nbsp; They had the boat-hook and they had the line, and that seemed to be all that they thought necessary to their work.</p><p>George was about to call out and wake them up, but, at that moment, a bright idea flashed across him, and he didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He got the hitcher instead, and reached over, and drew in the end of the tow-line; and they made a loop in it, and put it over their mast, and then they tidied up the sculls, and went and sat down in the stern, and lit their pipes.</p></div> </div>
