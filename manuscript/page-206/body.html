<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Where it is really the owners that are to blame, they ought to be shown up.&nbsp; The selfishness of the riparian proprietor grows with every year.&nbsp; If these men had their way they would close the river Thames altogether.&nbsp; They actually do this along the minor tributary streams and in the backwaters.&nbsp; They drive posts into the bed of the stream, and draw chains across from bank to bank, and nail huge notice-boards on every tree.&nbsp; The sight of those notice-boards rouses every evil instinct in my nature.&nbsp; I feel I want to tear each one down, and hammer it over the head of the man who put it up, until I have killed him, and then I would bury him, and put the board up over the grave as a tombstone.</p></div> </div>
