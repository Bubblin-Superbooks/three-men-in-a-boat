<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Harris, &ldquo;if you want rest and change, you can&rsquo;t beat a sea trip.&rdquo;</p><p>I objected to the sea trip strongly.&nbsp; A sea trip does you good when you are going to have a couple of months of it, but, for a week, it is wicked.</p><p>You start on Monday with the idea implanted in your bosom that you are going to enjoy yourself.&nbsp; You wave an airy adieu to the boys on shore, light your biggest pipe, and swagger about the deck as if you were Captain Cook, Sir Francis Drake, and Christopher Columbus all rolled into one.&nbsp; On Tuesday, you wish you hadn&rsquo;t come.&nbsp; On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, you wish you were dead.&nbsp; On Saturday, you are able to swallow a little beef tea, and to sit up on deck, and answer with a wan, sweet smile when kind-hearted people ask you how you feel now.</p></div> </div>
