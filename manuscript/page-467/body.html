<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; A rude boy on the bank immediately yelled out to a lagging chum to &ldquo;hurry up and see a real monkey on a stick.&rdquo;</p><p>I could not go to his assistance, because, as ill-luck would have it, we had not taken the proper precaution to bring out a spare pole with us.&nbsp; I could only sit and look at him.&nbsp; His expression as the pole slowly sank with him I shall never forget; there was so much thought in it.</p><p>I watched him gently let down into the water, and saw him scramble out, sad and wet.&nbsp; I could not help laughing, he looked such a ridiculous figure.&nbsp; I continued to chuckle to myself about it for some time, and then it was suddenly forced in upon me that really I had got very little to laugh at when I came to think of it.</p></div> </div>
