<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>They awe us, these strange stars, so cold, so clear.&nbsp; We are as children whose small feet have strayed into some dim-lit temple of the god they have been taught to worship but know not; and, standing where the echoing dome spans the long vista of the shadowy light, glance up, half hoping, half afraid to see some awful vision hovering there.</p><p>And yet it seems so full of comfort and of strength, the night.&nbsp; In its great presence, our small sorrows creep away, ashamed.&nbsp; The day has been so full of fret and care, and our hearts have been so full of evil and of bitter thoughts, and the world has seemed so hard and wrong to us.&nbsp; Then Night, like some great loving mother, gently lays her hand upon our fevered head, and turns our little tear-stained faces up to hers, and smiles;</p></div> </div>
