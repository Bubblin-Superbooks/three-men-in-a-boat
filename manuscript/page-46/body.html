<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>And we sit there, by its margin, while the moon, who loves it too, stoops down to kiss it with a sister&rsquo;s kiss, and throws her silver arms around it clingingly; and we watch it as it flows, ever singing, ever whispering, out to meet its king, the sea&mdash;till our voices die away in silence, and the pipes go out&mdash;till we, common-place, everyday young men enough, feel strangely full of thoughts, half sad, half sweet, and do not care or want to speak&mdash;till we laugh, and, rising, knock the ashes from our burnt-out pipes, and say &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; and, lulled by the lapping water and the rustling trees, we fall asleep beneath the great, still stars, and dream that the world is young again&mdash;young and sweet as she used to be ere the centuries of fret and care had furrowed her fair face, ere her children&rsquo;s sins and follies had made old her loving heart&mdash;</p></div> </div>
