<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We went over to Magna Charta Island, and had a look at the stone which stands in the cottage there and on which the great Charter is said to have been signed; though, as to whether it really was signed there, or, as some say, on the other bank at &ldquo;Runningmede,&rdquo; I decline to commit myself.&nbsp; As far as my own personal opinion goes, however, I am inclined to give weight to the popular island theory.&nbsp; Certainly, had I been one of the Barons, at the time, I should have strongly urged upon my comrades the advisability of our getting such a slippery customer as King John on to the island, where there was less chance of surprises and tricks.</p></div> </div>
