<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It always does seem to me that I am doing more work than I should do.&nbsp; It is not that I object to the work, mind you; I like work: it fascinates me.&nbsp; I can sit and look at it for hours.&nbsp; I love to keep it by me: the idea of getting rid of it nearly breaks my heart.</p><p>You cannot give me too much work; to accumulate work has almost become a passion with me: my study is so full of it now, that there is hardly an inch of room for any more.&nbsp; I shall have to throw out a wing soon.</p><p>And I am careful of my work, too.&nbsp; Why, some of the work that I have by me now has been in my possession for years and years, and there isn&rsquo;t a finger-mark on it.&nbsp; I take a great pride in my work; I take it down now and then and dust it.&nbsp; No man keeps his work in a better state of preservation than I do.</p></div> </div>
