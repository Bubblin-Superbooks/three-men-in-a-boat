<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I felt rather hurt about this at first; it seemed somehow to be a sort of slight.&nbsp; Why hadn&rsquo;t I got housemaid&rsquo;s knee?&nbsp; Why this invidious reservation?&nbsp; After a while, however, less grasping feelings prevailed.&nbsp; I reflected that I had every other known malady in the pharmacology, and I grew less selfish, and determined to do without housemaid&rsquo;s knee.&nbsp; Gout, in its most malignant stage, it would appear, had seized me without my being aware of it; and zymosis I had evidently been suffering with from boyhood.&nbsp; There were no more diseases after zymosis, so I concluded there was nothing else the matter with me.</p><p>I sat and pondered.&nbsp; I thought what an interesting case I must be from a medical point of view, what an acquisition I should be to a class!&nbsp; Students would have no need to &ldquo;walk the hospitals,&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
