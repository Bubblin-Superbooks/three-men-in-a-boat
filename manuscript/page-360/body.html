<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; In its unbroken loveliness this is, perhaps, the sweetest stretch of all the river, and lingeringly we slowly drew our little boat away from its deep peace.</p><p>We pulled up in the backwater, just below Cookham, and had tea; and, when we were through the lock, it was evening.&nbsp; A stiffish breeze had sprung up&mdash;in our favour, for a wonder; for, as a rule on the river, the wind is always dead against you whatever way you go.&nbsp; It is against you in the morning, when you start for a day&rsquo;s trip, and you pull a long distance, thinking how easy it will be to come back with the sail.&nbsp; Then, after tea, the wind veers round, and you have to pull hard in its teeth all the way home.</p></div> </div>
