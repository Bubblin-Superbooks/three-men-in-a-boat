<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I knew a young man once, he was a most conscientious fellow, and, when he took to fly-fishing, he determined never to exaggerate his hauls by more than twenty-five per cent.</p><p>&ldquo;When I have caught forty fish,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;then I will tell people that I have caught fifty, and so on.&nbsp; But I will not lie any more than that, because it is sinful to lie.&rdquo;</p><p>But the twenty-five per cent. plan did not work well at all.&nbsp; He never was able to use it.&nbsp; The greatest number of fish he ever caught in one day was three, and you can&rsquo;t add twenty-five per cent. to three&mdash;at least, not in fish.</p></div> </div>
