<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I could not see anything to laugh at, and I told George so, and he only laughed the more.&nbsp; I never saw a man laugh so much.&nbsp; I quite lost my temper with him at last, and I pointed out to him what a drivelling maniac of an imbecile idiot he was; but he only roared the louder.&nbsp; And then, just as I was landing the shirt, I noticed that it was not my shirt at all, but George&rsquo;s, which I had mistaken for mine; whereupon the humour of the thing struck me for the first time, and I began to laugh.&nbsp; And the more I looked from George&rsquo;s wet shirt to George, roaring with laughter, the more I was amused, and I laughed so much that I had to let the shirt fall back into the water again.</p></div> </div>
