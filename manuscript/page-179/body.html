<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>George has bought some new things for this trip, and I&rsquo;m rather vexed about them.&nbsp; The blazer is loud.&nbsp; I should not like George to know that I thought so, but there really is no other word for it.&nbsp; He brought it home and showed it to us on Thursday evening.&nbsp; We asked him what colour he called it, and he said he didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t think there was a name for the colour.&nbsp; The man had told him it was an Oriental design.&nbsp; George put it on, and asked us what we thought of it.&nbsp; Harris said that, as an object to hang over a flower-bed in early spring to frighten the birds away, he should respect it; but that, considered as an article of dress for any human being, except a Margate nigger, it made him ill.</p></div> </div>
