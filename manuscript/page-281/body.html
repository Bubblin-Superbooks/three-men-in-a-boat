<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now, rise, and show your strength.&nbsp; Be eloquent, and deep, and tender; see, with a clear eye, into Nature and into life; spread your white wings of quivering thought, and soar, a god-like spirit, over the whirling world beneath you, up through long lanes of flaming stars to the gates of eternity!&rdquo;</p><p>After hot muffins, it says, &ldquo;Be dull and soulless, like a beast of the field&mdash;a brainless animal, with listless eye, unlit by any ray of fancy, or of hope, or fear, or love, or life.&rdquo;&nbsp; And after brandy, taken in sufficient quantity, it says, &ldquo;Now, come, fool, grin and tumble, that your fellow-men may laugh&mdash;drivel in folly, and splutter in senseless sounds, and show what a helpless ninny is poor man whose wit and will are drowned, like kittens, side by side, in half an inch of alcohol.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
