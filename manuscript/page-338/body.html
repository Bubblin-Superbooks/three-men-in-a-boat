<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>From Picnic Point to Old Windsor Lock is a delightful bit of the river.&nbsp; A shady road, dotted here and there with dainty little cottages, runs by the bank up to the &ldquo;Bells of Ouseley,&rdquo; a picturesque inn, as most up-river inns are, and a place where a very good glass of ale may be drunk&mdash;so Harris says; and on a matter of this kind you can take Harris&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; Old Windsor is a famous spot in its way.&nbsp; Edward the Confessor had a palace here, and here the great Earl Godwin was proved guilty by the justice of that age of having encompassed the death of the King&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp; Earl Godwin broke a piece of bread and held it in his hand.</p></div> </div>
