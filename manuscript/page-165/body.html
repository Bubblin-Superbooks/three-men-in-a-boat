<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; In the sunlight&mdash;in the daytime, when Nature is alive and busy all around us, we like the open hill-sides and the deep woods well enough: but in the night, when our Mother Earth has gone to sleep, and left us waking, oh! the world seems so lonesome, and we get frightened, like children in a silent house.&nbsp; Then we sit and sob, and long for the gas-lit streets, and the sound of human voices, and the answering throb of human life.&nbsp; We feel so helpless and so little in the great stillness, when the dark trees rustle in the night-wind.&nbsp; There are so many ghosts about, and their silent sighs make us feel so sad.&nbsp; Let us gather together in the great cities, and light huge bonfires of a million gas-jets, and shout and sing together, and feel brave.</p></div> </div>
