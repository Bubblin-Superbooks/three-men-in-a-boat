<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The children of the town steal round to watch them, wondering; and brawny country wenches, laughing, draw near to bandy ale-house jest and jibe with the swaggering troopers, so unlike the village swains, who, now despised, stand apart behind, with vacant grins upon their broad, peering faces.&nbsp; And out from the fields around, glitter the faint lights of more distant camps, as here some great lord&rsquo;s followers lie mustered, and there false John&rsquo;s French mercenaries hover like crouching wolves without the town.</p><p>And so, with sentinel in each dark street, and twinkling watch-fires on each height around, the night has worn away, and over this fair valley of old Thame has broken the morning of the great day that is to close so big with the fate of ages yet unborn.</p></div> </div>
