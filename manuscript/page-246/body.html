<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One sees a good many funny incidents up the river in connection with towing.&nbsp; One of the most common is the sight of a couple of towers, walking briskly along, deep in an animated discussion, while the man in the boat, a hundred yards behind them, is vainly shrieking to them to stop, and making frantic signs of distress with a scull.&nbsp; Something has gone wrong; the rudder has come off, or the boat-hook has slipped overboard, or his hat has dropped into the water and is floating rapidly down stream.</p><p>He calls to them to stop, quite gently and politely at first.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi! stop a minute, will you?&rdquo; he shouts cheerily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve dropped my hat over-board.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
