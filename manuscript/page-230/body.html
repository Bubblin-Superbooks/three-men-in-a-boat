<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We sculled up to Walton, a rather large place for a riverside town.&nbsp; As with all riverside places, only the tiniest corner of it comes down to the water, so that from the boat you might fancy it was a village of some half-dozen houses, all told.&nbsp; Windsor and Abingdon are the only towns between London and Oxford that you can really see anything of from the stream.&nbsp; All the others hide round corners, and merely peep at the river down one street: my thanks to them for being so considerate, and leaving the river-banks to woods and fields and water-works.</p><p>Even Reading, though it does its best to spoil and sully and make hideous as much of the river as it can reach, is good-natured enough to keep its ugly face a good deal out of sight.</p></div> </div>
