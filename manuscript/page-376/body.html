<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I remember being in the lobby of the Haymarket Stores one day, and all round about me were dogs, waiting for the return of their owners, who were shopping inside.&nbsp; There were a mastiff, and one or two collies, and a St. Bernard, a few retrievers and Newfoundlands, a boar-hound, a French poodle, with plenty of hair round its head, but mangy about the middle; a bull-dog, a few Lowther Arcade sort of animals, about the size of rats, and a couple of Yorkshire tykes.</p><p>There they sat, patient, good, and thoughtful.&nbsp; A solemn peacefulness seemed to reign in that lobby.&nbsp; An air of calmness and resignation&mdash;of gentle sadness pervaded the room.</p></div> </div>
