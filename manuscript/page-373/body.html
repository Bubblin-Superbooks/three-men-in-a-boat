<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Cistercian monks, whose abbey stood there in the thirteenth century, wore no clothes but rough tunics and cowls, and ate no flesh, nor fish, nor eggs.&nbsp; They lay upon straw, and they rose at midnight to mass.&nbsp; They spent the day in labour, reading, and prayer; and over all their lives there fell a silence as of death, for no one spoke.</p><p>A grim fraternity, passing grim lives in that sweet spot, that God had made so bright!&nbsp; Strange that Nature&rsquo;s voices all around them&mdash;the soft singing of the waters, the whisperings of the river grass, the music of the rushing wind&mdash;should not have taught them a truer meaning of life than this.&nbsp; They listened there, through the long days, in silence, waiting for a voice from heaven; and all day long and through the solemn night it spoke to them in myriad tones, and they heard it not.</p></div> </div>
