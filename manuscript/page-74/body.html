<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>the dread of what will my neighbour think, with luxuries that only cloy, with pleasures that bore, with empty show that, like the criminal&rsquo;s iron crown of yore, makes to bleed and swoon the aching head that wears it!</p><p>It is lumber, man&mdash;all lumber!&nbsp; Throw it overboard.&nbsp; It makes the boat so heavy to pull, you nearly faint at the oars.&nbsp; It makes it so cumbersome and dangerous to manage, you never know a moment&rsquo;s freedom from anxiety and care, never gain a moment&rsquo;s rest for dreamy laziness&mdash;no time to watch the windy shadows skimming lightly o&rsquo;er the shallows, or the glittering sunbeams flitting in and out among the ripples, or the great trees by the margin looking down at their own image, or the woods all green and golden, or the lilies white and yellow, or the sombre-waving rushes, or the sedges, or the orchis, or the blue forget-me-nots.</p></div> </div>
