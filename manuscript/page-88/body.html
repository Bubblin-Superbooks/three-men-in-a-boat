<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I remember a friend of mine, buying a couple of cheeses at Liverpool.&nbsp; Splendid cheeses they were, ripe and mellow, and with a two hundred horse-power scent about them that might have been warranted to carry three miles, and knock a man over at two hundred yards.&nbsp; I was in Liverpool at the time, and my friend said that if I didn&rsquo;t mind he would get me to take them back with me to London, as he should not be coming up for a day or two himself, and he did not think the cheeses ought to be kept much longer.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, with pleasure, dear boy,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;with pleasure.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
