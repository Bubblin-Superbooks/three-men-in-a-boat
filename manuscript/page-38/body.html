<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For myself, I have discovered an excellent preventive against sea-sickness, in balancing myself.&nbsp; You stand in the centre of the deck, and, as the ship heaves and pitches, you move your body about, so as to keep it always straight.&nbsp; When the front of the ship rises, you lean forward, till the deck almost touches your nose; and when its back end gets up, you lean backwards.&nbsp; This is all very well for an hour or two; but you can&rsquo;t balance yourself for a week.</p><p>George said:</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up the river.&rdquo;</p><p>He said we should have fresh air, exercise and quiet; the constant change of scene would occupy our minds (including what there was of Harris&rsquo;s); and the hard work would give us a good appetite, and make us sleep well.</p></div> </div>
