<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>t see them, and they take the sea and put it two miles out, so that I have to huddle myself up in my arms and hop, shivering, through six inches of water.&nbsp; And when I do get to the sea, it is rough and quite insulting.</p><p>One huge wave catches me up and chucks me in a sitting posture, as hard as ever it can, down on to a rock which has been put there for me.&nbsp; And, before I&rsquo;ve said &ldquo;Oh! Ugh!&rdquo; and found out what has gone, the wave comes back and carries me out to mid-ocean.&nbsp; I begin to strike out frantically for the shore, and wonder if I shall ever see home and friends again, and wish I&rsquo;d been kinder to my little sister when a boy (when I was a boy, I mean).</p></div> </div>
