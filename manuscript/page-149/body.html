<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Speaking of oak staircases reminds me that there is a magnificent carved oak staircase in one of the houses in Kingston.&nbsp; It is a shop now, in the market-place, but it was evidently once the mansion of some great personage.&nbsp; A friend of mine, who lives at Kingston, went in there to buy a hat one day, and, in a thoughtless moment, put his hand in his pocket and paid for it then and there.</p><p>The shopman (he knows my friend) was naturally a little staggered at first; but, quickly recovering himself, and feeling that something ought to be done to encourage this sort of thing, asked our hero if he would like to see some fine old carved oak.&nbsp; My friend said he would, and the shopman, thereupon, took him through the shop, and up the staircase of the house.</p></div> </div>
