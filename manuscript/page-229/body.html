<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I pulled splendidly.&nbsp; I got well into a steady rhythmical swing.&nbsp; I put my arms, and my legs, and my back into it.&nbsp; I set myself a good, quick, dashing stroke, and worked in really grand style.&nbsp; My two friends said it was a pleasure to watch me.&nbsp; At the end of five minutes, I thought we ought to be pretty near the weir, and I looked up.&nbsp; We were under the bridge, in exactly the same spot that we were when I began, and there were those two idiots, injuring themselves by violent laughing.&nbsp; I had been grinding away like mad to keep that boat stuck still under that bridge.&nbsp; I let other people pull up backwaters against strong streams now.</p></div> </div>
