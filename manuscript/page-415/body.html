<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>George said it was absurd to have only four potatoes in an Irish stew, so we washed half-a-dozen or so more, and put them in without peeling.&nbsp; We also put in a cabbage and about half a peck of peas.&nbsp; George stirred it all up, and then he said that there seemed to be a lot of room to spare, so we overhauled both the hampers, and picked out all the odds and ends and the remnants, and added them to the stew.&nbsp; There were half a pork pie and a bit of cold boiled bacon left, and we put them in.&nbsp; Then George found half a tin of potted salmon, and he emptied that into the pot.</p></div> </div>
