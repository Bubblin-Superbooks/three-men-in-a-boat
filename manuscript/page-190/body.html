<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was a lovely landscape.&nbsp; It was idyllic, poetical, and it inspired me.&nbsp; I felt good and noble.&nbsp; I felt I didn&rsquo;t want to be sinful and wicked any more.&nbsp; I would come and live here, and never do any more wrong, and lead a blameless, beautiful life, and have silver hair when I got old, and all that sort of thing.</p><p>In that moment I forgave all my friends and relations for their wickedness and cussedness, and I blessed them.&nbsp; They did not know that I blessed them.&nbsp; They went their abandoned way all unconscious of what I, far away in that peaceful village, was doing for them; but I did it, and I wished that I could let them know that I had done it, because I wanted to make them happy.</p></div> </div>
