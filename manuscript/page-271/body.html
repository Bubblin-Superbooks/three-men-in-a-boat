<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We had originally intended to go on to Magna Charta Island, a sweetly pretty part of the river, where it winds through a soft, green valley, and to camp in one of the many picturesque inlets to be found round that tiny shore.&nbsp; But, somehow, we did not feel that we yearned for the picturesque nearly so much now as we had earlier in the day.&nbsp; A bit of water between a coal-barge and a gas-works would have quite satisfied us for that night.&nbsp; We did not want scenery.&nbsp; We wanted to have our supper and go to bed.&nbsp; However, we did pull up to the point&mdash;&ldquo;Picnic Point,&rdquo; it is called&mdash;and dropped into a very pleasant nook under a great elm-tree, to the spreading roots of which we fastened the boat.</p></div> </div>
