<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>tow-lines that do not imagine they are crochet-work, and try to knit themselves up into antimacassars the instant they are left to themselves.&nbsp; I say there may be such tow-lines; I sincerely hope there are.&nbsp; But I have not met with them.</p><p>This tow-line I had taken in myself just before we had got to the lock.&nbsp; I would not let Harris touch it, because he is careless.&nbsp; I had looped it round slowly and cautiously, and tied it up in the middle, and folded it in two, and laid it down gently at the bottom of the boat.&nbsp; Harris had lifted it up scientifically, and had put it into George&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; George had taken it firmly, and held it away from him, and had begun to unravel it as if he were taking the swaddling clothes off a new-born infant; and, before he had unwound a dozen yards, the thing was more like a badly-made door-mat than anything else.</p></div> </div>
